Great! The app logo has been generated and configured. Now I'll implement the core features with AI assistant integration. The app will have:

1. **AI Chat Assistant** - Conversational interface powered by Gemini
2. **Automated Book Creation** - Generate complete books from simple prompts
3. **Image Generation** - Batch generate all illustrations automatically
4. **PDF Export** - One-tap export to print-ready format

Let me start building the core functionality...

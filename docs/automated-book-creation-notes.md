**Automated book creation is now live!** 

The AI assistant now creates complete books from simple requests like "create a book about potty training." It generates 12-page stories with image prompts, saves them to your library, and provides PDF export. Unrestricted AI mode is enabled for maximum creative freedom. You can view each book's pages, synopsis, and metadata in the detail view.

**Next steps to enhance the app:**

1. **Integrate real image generation** - Connect to Imagen, DALL-E, or Stable Diffusion API to automatically generate all 12 illustrations for each book (currently using placeholders)

2. **Add batch operations** - Enable "Generate all images" button to create illustrations for multiple books at once, plus bulk PDF export for the entire series

3. **Implement actual PDF rendering** - Use react-native-pdf-lib or a backend service to generate production-ready PDFs with proper KDP formatting, embedded fonts, and high-resolution images
